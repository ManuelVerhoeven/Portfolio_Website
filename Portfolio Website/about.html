		<h2>Manuel Verhoeven</h2>
		<p>I'm a 24 year old free thinking creative person, I have a passion for art and technology so I decided to become a digital designer. Currently I have finished my under graduated degree at Curtin University and working as a freelancer animator and web designer while supplementing my income with landscape work in between projects all whist I enjoy life. My current goal is to develop up my portfolio with freelance projects and personal projects and perhaps land a stable job within the industry.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a open mind, relaxed guy, my heritage is Dutch and I migrated to Australia in 2004. I have  extensively traveled the world and view myself as cultured, I'm also fluent in both Dutch and English. In my spare time I enjoy maintaining a large veggie garden where I grow my own food, I also like to stay active, I'm part of sailing club, I’m a travel enthusiast, enjoy catching up with my friends and play computer games.</p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p>
			As a freshly graduated, my experience is limited, the majority of my experiences are projects that I completed while at Curtin University I have had one client project where I designed a flyer. In the near future I have three possible upcoming projects, an animation for a client wishing to sell specialized european glass, a website for a small business and a website for a sport club. I plan to bolster this with personal projects, one continuing my youtube fish animations and to 3D model of a sailing boat. My experience outside of digital design consist of customer service, handling client as well as fellow employees and working in a team towards a final project outcome.</p>

		<h3>3D Artist</h3>
		<p>I have a passion for 3D modeling I enjoyed this aspect the most in my degree. I have from a young age been skilled at working with 3D which all started with lego, which turned into drawing and than into sculptures of clay and other materials when I got older. It was not hard to adapted my skill with 3D into the digital realm. most of my university projects were made with Maya, Mudbox and Zbrush and where aimed at game design and animation. I have also worked on 3D architecture models in the past with programs such as Archicad and is an area where I would like my career to go, I have also previously worked with Pro-desktop.</p>

		<h3>2D Artist</h3>
		<p>I have some experience with 2D animation and graphic design, my skills with 2D animation lay in story telling, educating and short comedy. My method is hand drawing storyboards, creating assets in Photoshop, voice record, collect other assets and animate in After Effects. Im also quite adept at using photoshop to create and composite imagery and to a achieve desired outcome.</p>
		<h3>Web Design</h3>
		<p>I enjoy the coding element of web design, I view it as a puzzle where i decide how the pieces fit together. My experience with web design is mostly static websites, with my experience being an E-learning website teaching kids about tornados and this Portfolio website. I have had an introduction and have limited experience in building websites using word press. In the near future I have plans to develop word press websites through freelance projects to further my knowledge and gain more experience.</p>
